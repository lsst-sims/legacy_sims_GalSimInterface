The current defined classes are `GalSimStars` (for galactic point sources), `GalSimGalaxies` (for any object with a 2-D Sersic profile), and `GalSimAgn` (for extra-galactic point sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create GalSim images, you need to instantiate one of these catalogs (or, more likely, a daughter-class of one these catalogs) and write it out using the usual `write_catalog()` method.  This will produce a text file with a list of all of the objects and a bunch of data about each, including which detector saw them.  As the catalog is writing itself to text, it will also be creating images of each object and adding it to the final image file for each detector.  After calling `write_catalog()`, you can write the stored images to FITS files by calling `write_images()`.\n",

    "<b>Note:</b> if you call `write_images()` before calling `write_catalog()`, you will get empty FITS files.  `write_images()` just outputs the images already stored in the system.  Only `write_catalog()` iterates over and draws the objects in the catalog.\n",

    "I know that the above makes it sound like you can only generate images with one class of object at a time.  What actually happens when you instantiate a `GalSimCatalog` class is that it creates a `GalSimInterpreter` object.  The `GalSimInterpreter` is the class which actually does the work of creating the images.  If you wanted to create a series of GalSim images with, for instance, both stars and galaxies in them, you can use the `GalSimCatalog` method `copyGalSimInterpreter` to pass the `GalSimInterpreter` from one catalog to another, i.e you would (in pseudo-code):\n",
